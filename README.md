### Inspiration

I wanted to see if I could design my own hardware and wanted something that I could use to do things a normal keyboard coudn't do like openening apps and launching command that I use all the time.

### Challenges

This was my first time designing hardware and modeling in fusion. It was a very rewarding experience and I can't wait to desing some more custom hardware for highway. Fusion was definitely a challenge as the same thing doesnt work every time and I spent a lot of time looking things up. If I ever design one again I want to incorporate the other hardware that I didnt know I had access too like the OLED and volume knob.
